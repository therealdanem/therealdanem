- 👋 Hi, I’m @therealdanem
- 👀 I’m interested in game development as well as any other coding projects that may catch my interest.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Godot (and it's scripting language GDScript), Javascript, Python, Scratch, and C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...? I'm not sure, I don't have a ton of time for collaborations yet.
- 📫 How to reach me...I'll put something here later.
